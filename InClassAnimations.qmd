# Introduction

I am using the packages and techniques that are available at (this article)\[https://towardsdatascience.com/animating-your-data-visualizations-like-a-boss-using-r-f94ae20843e3\] to create an animation of data similar to the one that was showed in one of my social psych classes by Hans *Gosling?*.

# Code Starts Here

## Loading in Libraries and Necessary Packages

```{r}
necessary_packages <- c("ggplot2","gganimate")

for (package in necessary_packages) {
  if(!require(package, character.only = TRUE)){
    install.packages(package)
    library(package,character.only = TRUE)
  }
}
```

## Importing the Data:

```{r}
library(readr)
KratomSales <- read_csv("KratomSales1.csv")

```

```{r}
head(KratomSales)
```
